# 🎭 Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Text-Guided Frame Selection

This repository implements an **efficient, explainable, and edge-ready multimodal emotion recognition model** that fuses **video, audio, and text** streams using several novel modules.

---

## 🧩 1. Text-Guided Differentiable Hard Top-K Frame Selection

### 🔍 What it is
Instead of typical soft attention over all frames, the model learns to **pick the K most relevant frames** for emotion inference — **guided by the dialogue text**.

It uses a **straight-through estimator (STE)** to make the **hard Top-K selection differentiable**, so it can be trained end-to-end.

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
- Most multimodal emotion recognition (MER) works use *soft attention* (continuous weighting).  
- This version performs **discrete, text-conditioned frame sampling** that is both **efficient** and **interpretable**.  
- It bridges **language context** (“what’s being said”) with **visual saliency** (“which frames matter”), which is rarely done explicitly in MER.

### 📊 Outcome
- Balanced frame histogram proves it’s **not position-biased**.  
- **Dramatically reduces compute** — only *K of 12* frames are processed downstream.

## ⚙️ 2. Data-Conditioned, Per-Channel Fusion Gate (Dynamic GMU-style)

### 🔍 What it is
A trainable gate `g(x_v, x_a, x_t)` predicts how to weight **visual vs. audio features**, per-sample and per-channel.

Unlike static fusion weights, this gate reacts to the **actual content** (e.g., louder speech → more audio weight).

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
Extends the original **GMU (Gated Multimodal Unit, 2017)** with:
- **Per-channel gating** (not a single scalar per modality)
- **Conditioning on text**, not just visual/audio
- Optional **reliability heads** (`r_v`, `r_a`) that estimate per-modality confidence

Enables **adaptive, reliability-aware fusion** — a form of *learned trust calibration* between modalities.

---

## 🧠 3. Reliability-Aware Fusion (Confidence Modulation)

### 🔍 What it is
Small sigmoid heads predict reliabilities for visual and audio features.  
These reliabilities modulate the fusion:

\[
r_v \cdot g \cdot v + r_a \cdot (1-g) \cdot a
\]

…meaning the model can **down-weight noisy modalities**.

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
- Explicit **uncertainty modeling** in multimodal fusion is rare.  
- Brings **interpretability** and **robustness** — if audio is corrupted, the gate automatically leans more on vision.

---

## 🔄 4. Unified End-to-End Multimodal Learning with Efficient Text Cross-Attention

### 🔍 What it is
After fusion, the **text embeddings attend to the fused audiovisual token** via cross-attention.  
This ensures linguistic semantics refine emotion inference — without a heavy transformer stack.

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
- Avoids massive video-language models.  
- Achieves contextual alignment with only **one cross-attention layer**.  
- Retains **edge-device efficiency** while preserving cross-modal reasoning ability.

## 🪶 5. Edge-Optimized Multimodal Architecture

### 🔍 What it is
- Uses **MobileNetV3-Small** backbone (grayscale, 1-channel)  
- Employs a **lightweight 1D conv audio encoder**

The entire network is **<10 M parameters**, trainable on modest hardware, deployable on mobile GPUs.

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
Demonstrates that **near-SOTA accuracy** can be achieved with **<100 MB model size**, enabling **real-time emotion detection** on low-power devices — an under-explored direction in MER.

---

## 💬 6. Explainable Frame-Level Visualization

### 🔍 What it is
Through `show_prediction_sample()`, the model outputs **frame indices ranked by text-guided relevance**.

These visualizations act as **interpretable attention maps**, showing which temporal segments triggered emotional inference.

### 🧠 Why it’s novel
- Provides a clear **interpretability tool** for emotion recognition — not a black box.  
- Lets you visually demonstrate **emotion saliency alignment** between video, text, and audio.
